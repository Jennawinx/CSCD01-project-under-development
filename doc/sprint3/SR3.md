1. What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:
   - Creating implementation design documents  
   - Having dev meeting when we run into issues or need help  
   - Update the team member in case you work on his or her task or class for any minimum change  
   - Make sure to mention the ticket number in all branch names and commit messages to make it easier to track our progress.  
   - Start planning sprints tasks, breakdowns, assignments, estimates and acceptance criterias on google docs (and then copy them over to JIRA).  
  
  
2. What are some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint?
   - Creating implementation design documents for all features especially   
   - Creating endpoint specifications (ie api calls and return)  
   - Make better estimates for smaller tasks   
   - Allocate time to prepare for our presentation  
  
  
3. What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint(stop doing?)
   - Creating implementation design documents for all features especially   
   - Creating endpoint specifications (ie api calls and return)  
   - Make better estimates for smaller tasks   
   - Allocate time to prepare for our presentation  
  
  
4. What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2?
    - What went well:
        - We completed a lot more story points as compared to previous sprints  
        - We finished 2 big features/requirements of the product backlog  

    - What needs to improve:
        - Leave at least a day to test all implemented features so that we can fix bugs.  
        - Task clarity, acceptance criterias and better time estimates for subtasks.    
        - Ensure all commits have a ticket number (even for bugs or modifications). Commit messages should start with the associated ticket number.  
        - Go through our presentation at least once before the real one.  
        - Standardized field names.  

5. New User Stories / Issues:  
__*__ = Bug  
__^__ = Not complete  
__!__ = New user story    
  
__*__ Investigate null errors that happen with page navigation.   
__^__ As a user, I should be able to delete/edit their own post (it's done but need to connect it to the Zone).  
__^__ As a user, I should be able to search for a post by providing a title (it's done but need to connect it to the Zone).  
__^__ As a user, I should be able to edit their own comments (it's done but need to connect it to the Zone).  
__^__ Multiplayer Trivia point changes should follow the new scoring system.    
__!__ As a user, I should always see others userâ€™s username and ACS score.    
__!__ Daily counts should automatically reset when it is a new day.
