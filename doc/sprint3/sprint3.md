# Sprint 3 Planning Meeting 

## Meeting Goal
Discuss what user stories we want to implement for sprint 3, break them down into tasks, assign them to team members. 

## Attendees
- Devanshi Parekh
- Rashida Kapadia
- Maunica Toleti
- Zhi Hua Lim 
- Jenny Quach
- Anmole Bajwa

## Team Capacity
Total capacity: 6 hours/day  
Number of days in sprint: 10  
Number of team members: 6  
Using focus factor (F.F. - 0.6 - 0.8): 0.7  
Team capacity = 6*4*10*0.7 = 252 hours  

## Sprint Goals
- Create multiplayer trivia game, and invite another user play with the same game with the 10 randomized questions
- Allow the invited user to join the same game
- Send notifications to a user that has been invited to play the game
- Send notifications of game results when both players have finished the game
- Allow users to play upto 5 games a day.
- Update ACS and its history of each user after they play the game.
- Implement ‘The Zone’ where users can view their posts as well as other users’ posts.
- Allow users to search for specific posts in ‘The Zone’ based on their title.
- Allow users to edit and delete their own posts.
- Allow users to agree or disagree to posts made by other users.
- Allow users to comment on a post. They can also edit and delete their comments.
- Fix bugs and new design changes from sprint 2: validation for birthday range, ensure ACS does not go below 100 and above 1100, initialize ACS to 200 when a new user signs up, fix null errors with navigation.


## Spikes
1. Trivia
  - Refactoring solo player trivia for multiplayer trivia
2. Connecting the frontend and backend
 - Flutter has a lot of issues with Null exceptions with vague messages when we try to call and get data from the backend. It is also very difficult and time consuming to debug.
