# Summary

## Key Project Objective:

To build an app to allow sports fans to engage in the sports community and build and maintain an ACS score.
The app should allow users to sign in using their email/phone number to encourage one profile per user. Users should also be able to log in to the app.
 It should allow users to build their A.C.S scores in the sports community through participating in various activities including picks and predictions, trivia and overall app usage.
These scores will then allow you to debate with members within the same tier (which is determined by their A.C.S.).

## The Key Personas:

**1. Jerry King: New to Sports**  
A thirty-nine year old History professor who enjoys spending his free time reading comics and mystery novels. He heard about the raptors rally and their huge win. He then became really interested in the game and wants to learn more about it.  

**2. Jake Collins: Intermediate Knowledge of sports**  
A 21 year old university student, who lives in Toronto. He keeps up with the Toronto Raptors, doesn’t watch all their games since he is busy with school, so most of the time he will watch the game highlights. He is more invested during playoff season.    

**3. Noah Carson: Expert in sports**  
A 17 year old captain of his highschool basketball team, he eats and breathes basketball. Out of all his friends he is always the first one to know about all the latest news. He is also training outside of school to become a professional basketball player.   

**4. Steph Curry: Competitive Athlete**  
Curry, an all star NBA player, has won many championships and has even won MVP twice. Curry trains for most of his day so he doesn't have much time to spend on his mobile. He also isn't easily moved by others' opinions and often finds them unreliable. However, Curry still strives to improve his strategies in games and one day wants to continue his basketball passion as a coach, so he often analyzes other matches during the season, taking close notes.

## Key Usage Scenarios

* Heading towards Christmas break and on the start of a back to back without some important players, the Raptors are in need of a pick- me- up. Basketball enthusiast, Noah Carson has her own analysis for picks and predictions of an upcoming game of Raptors vs Dallas. Only 20 points short before he becomes a pro- analyst, he is going to put his predictions down on selection of players a night before the game.

* Playoffs are right around the corner and Jake Collins wanted to watch the seeding game with his friends in a bar but due to a sudden lockdown in response to covid, their plans were cancelled for the day. To kill off his boredom he challenged his friend who is in the same tier as him for a round of trivia and beat his opponent with a score difference of 15. Officially becoming an analyst now he wants to share his score on twitter with hashtag #SportsCredAnalyst.

* As the summer begins, new assistants are joining Prof. King’s department and he plans  a mix and mingle event for his team as an ice breaker. As the mix and mingle ended, Jerry King learnt about SportsCred from his new assistants and decided to join it. Not a tech savvy, he wants to easily set up his profile and work around its features without any hustle.

* It’s that time of the year and all Basketball fans are hooked on the NBA season. Jerry is keenly following all the news and posts on the open court and loving the enthusiasm. Being a Raptors fan now, he wants to post something in support of his team and tag his favourite players in that post.
