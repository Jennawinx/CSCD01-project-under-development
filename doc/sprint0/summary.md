# Summary

## Key Project Objective:

To build an app to allow sports fans to engage in the sports community and build and maintain an ACS score.
The app should allow users to sign in using their email/phone number to encourage one profile per user. Users should also be able to log in to the app.
 It should allow users to build their A.C.S scores in the sports community through participating in various activities including picks and predictions, trivia and overall app usage.
These scores will then allow you to debate with members within the same tier (which is determined by their A.C.S.).

## The Key Personas:

**1. Jerry King: New to Sports**  
A 45 year old History professor who enjoys spending his free time reading thesis papers for his research. He is a family oriented man and wanted to spend more time and bond with his kids. Both his kids are fans of basketball and so he decides to learn more about it so that he can relate with his children. 

**2. Jo Xu: Intermediate Knowledge of sports**  
A 21 year old university student, who lives in Toronto. She keeps up with the Toronto Raptors, doesn’t watch all their games since she is busy with school, so most of the time she will watch the game highlights. She is more invested during playoff season.    

**3. Sanjana Patel: Expert in sports**  
A 17 year old captain of his highschool basketball team, she eats and breathes basketball. Out of all her friends she is always the first one to know about all the latest news. She is also training outside of school to become a professional basketball player.

## Key Usage Scenarios

* Heading towards Christmas break and on the start of a back to back without some important players, the Raptors are in need of a pick- me- up. Basketball enthusiast, Sanjana Patel has her own analysis for picks and predictions of an upcoming game of Raptors vs Dallas. Only 20 points short before she becomes a pro- analyst, she is going to put his predictions down on selection of players a night before the game.

* Playoffs are right around the corner and Jo Xu wanted to watch the seeding game with her friends in a bar but due to a sudden lockdown in response to covid, their plans were cancelled for the day. To kill off her boredom she challenged her friend who is in the same tier as her for a round of trivia and beat her opponent with a score difference of 15. Officially becoming an analyst now, she wants to share her score on twitter with hashtag #SportsCredAnalyst.

* As the summer begins, new assistants are joining Prof. King’s department and he plans a mix and mingle event for his team as an ice breaker. As the mix and mingle ended, Jerry King learnt about SportsCred from his new assistants and decided to join it. Not a tech savvy, he wants to easily set up his profile and work around its features without any hustle.

* It’s that time of the year and all Basketball fans are hooked on the NBA season. Jerry is keenly following all the news and posts on the open court and loving the enthusiasm. Being a Raptors fan now, he wants to post something in support of his team and tag his favourite players in that post.
