# Process

#### Reflect on how your team worked together.

We split the tasks up amongst us with 2-3 people working on each component such as the personas, user experience and product backlog. We then went over it together in the several meetings across the week to check up on our progress. Our communication was really good too as all of us responded on time using messenger/discord. We also set up a meeting with Warren to go over our pending questions, learn more about the app and show him our wireframe, which he loved.

#### How did you organize the team?

We have 6 people in the team and have decided that 3 people will work on front-end and 3 for back-end. This will be modified depending on the features we decide to implement in each sprint.

For Sprint 0, we organized our team as follows:

* Summary.md  
   * Rashida, Anmole, Devanshi, Jenny

* Competition.md  
   * Maunica, zhi hua

* Personas.pdf  
    * Rashida, Devanshi

* Product Backlog  
    * ALL

* User Experience/User Interface (Google Slides)  
    * Anmole, Jenny, Maunica, zhi hua

* Process.md  
    * ALL

* Done.md  
    * ALL 

#### Which tools did you use, if any?

We used Discord and Facebook Messenger for communication, google drive to share collaborative resources, google docs to discuss and edit concurrently, and google slides to create a wireframe mockup together for the app. We used Zoom to set up our meeting with Warren. We also used When2Meet to put down our availabilities to make it easier to schedule meetings.

#### How did you make decisions?

We had group meetings to discuss the main topics and to split up the work. Other smaller decisions were made by texting either on discord or messenger. For some decisions we made a poll on messenger, where we went with the choice that had the most votes. For other decisions we just each voiced our opinion and went with the choice that most people agreed with. 

How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

We set up a meeting with Warren to go over which features are the most important. We found that especially for the upcoming sprints, we will need to develop the questionnaire, log in, sign up and the zone as the highest priority. He also emphasized that picks and predictions would be the highest priority feature of the app.

#### Did you meet in person or online?

We met online, during our meetings scheduled on Discord. 

#### How frequently did you meet?

We had three scheduled online meetings spread out throughout the week for the whole group. We also had smaller group meetings for each particular task, where only the people assigned to that task had to attend.

#### What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

First and the foremost lesson is to never delay any of your doubts until the last moment. Have your questions cleared at the very moment. We have learned that our client was very willing to answer all our questions and it didn't take long to clear things up. As soon as the sprint begins prioritize the duties and have them assigned, keeping in mind the workload of each individual so that everyone finishes whatever they are assigned. 
For the next phase, we plan on having Sprint meetings every Saturday and work on our tasks during the week. We aim to finish our tasks at least a day before it is due.
