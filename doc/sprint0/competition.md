Our app provides sports fans with a platform to socialize with other fans while improving their ability to predict and analyze scores. There currently exist the following apps that try to solve a similar problem:

1.	theScore (Cross-platform app) - https://www.thescore.com/news/1636785

7.	Sportsnet - https://www.sportsnet.ca/sn-apps/

8.	Basketball reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/ 

The above apps and websites have some features that are similar to our app, however, our app contains all these elements along with some unique features that have never been seen on the market before. For example, theScore and 365Scores both allow users to personalize their dashboards according to their favourite sports, view sports scores and updates, and engage in conversations with other users regarding game outcomes, sports news or announcements. On the other hand, the websites and forums above allow users to stay updated on sports news and statistics and engage in sports related discussions. However, none of the aforementioned apps provide a feature to help improve the fans’ ability to predict and analyze scores. The lack of this feature leads to them making potentially false claims about the scores or the game itself. 

Our app is different from the apps above because it not only provides a social platform for fans to interact with each other to discuss sports, it also provides a platform for them to improve their analytical and predicting skills. It is targeted for sports fans and sports spectators who want to get better at predicting and analyzing scores. In addition, each user is associated with an Analytics Credit Score (ACS), which is guaranteed to make our app a game changer in the market. The ACS can be increased through participating in various activities in our app such as the trivia, debates, picks and predictions. The users also get to engage and interact through these activities by transferring their scores to one another, such as in trivia. The users are categorized into different levels and can grow from being Fanalysts to Expert Analysts to keep them motivated to use our app. While certain sites such as reddit also have a similar function, what separates ACS from these systems is the inclusion of retroactive evaluations of outcomes and scenarios, allowing for a more objective view of a user’s analytical skills.

The competitors mentioned above may not have included an analytical aspect to their app as gathering data is time consuming and costly. Moreover, their main focus was to keep users updated on the current sports news to give them a platform to engage in discussions with other users. However, our app is a one stop shop for all sports fans as it includes all these aspects along with our most distinguishing feature, the ACS. Therefore, our app not only provides fans and newcomers with a way to learn more about the sport and engage with fellow members of the community, it also gives them a way to showcase their knowledge and finally settle the question of “who is the biggest fan?” during sports conversations.
