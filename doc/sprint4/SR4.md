__1. What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?__  
   - Creating implementation design documents
   - Having dev meeting when we run into issues or need help
   - Update the team member in case you work on his or her task or class for any minimum change
   - Make sure to mention the ticket number in all branch names and commit messages to make it easier to track our progress.
   - Start planning sprints tasks, breakdowns, assignments, estimates and acceptance criterias on google docs (and then copy them over to JIRA)
   - Creating endpoint specification documentation (ie api calls and return)
   - Test our own work thoroughly before merging to the dev branch
   - Make better estimates for smaller tasks
    
__2. What are some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint?__     
   - Start working a lot earlier for the sprint to reduce stress closer to the deadline
   - Practice in advance and prepare well for our presentation. 
   - Improve Testing: Find potential bugs in the app and fix it as soon as possible.
    
__3. What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint(stop doing?)__  
   - We should finish all the tasks by the monday of demo week, and leave 1-2 days for debugging and testing (and maybe improve the UX).
   - Our branch should not be too many commits behind from dev when we are working on it. This will increase conflicts and make it harder to merge changes.
  
__4. What was your best/worst experience during sprint 4?__  
   - What went well:
       - We completed all our story points for this sprint
       - We finished 2 big features/requirements of the product backlog
       - We met to plan out the flow and the api calls for debate
   - What needs to improve:
       - Leave at least a day to test all implemented features so that we can fix bugs.
       - Task clarity and acceptance criterias, better time estimates for subtasks
       - Ensure all commits have a ticket number (even for bugs or modifications). Commit messages should start with the associated ticket number.
       - Go through our presentation at least once before the real one.
  
__5. New User Stories/ Issues:__  
   *Sprints have ended. We will now spend a majority of our time to work on UI changes for the remaining days before our presentation.*  
    
   Bug: Index Error shows up when groups have less than 3 people in it for debate (Results Page).  
     
   UI Improvements:  
   - Confetti should only be seen when the current user has won a debate round.  
   - ACS Score should be displayed whenever the usernames are displayed on the app.
