1. What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:
    - Having dev meeting when we run into issues or need help
    - Update the team member in case you work on his or her task or class for any minimum change

2. What are some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint?
    - Make sure to mention the ticket number in all branch names and commit messages to make it easier to track our progress.
    - Start planning sprints tasks, breakdowns, assignments, estimates and acceptance criterias on google docs (and then copy them over to JIRA)

3. What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint(stop doing?)
    - We should finish all the tasks by the monday of demo week, and leave 1-2 days for debugging and testing (and maybe improve the UX) rather than finishing 1-2 hours before demo

4. What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2?
    - What went well:
        - Finished all the user stories that we planned on completing
    - What needs to improve:
        - Leave at least a day to test all implemented features so that we can fix bugs.
        - Task clarity and acceptance criterias, better time estimates for subtasks
        - Ensure all commits have a ticket number (even for bugs or modifications). Commit messages should start with the associated ticket number.

5. New User Stories / Issues:
    * Issues
        * If a user force closes the app when in the middle of the trivia, the should get -10 points deduction in ACS history
        * Investigate null errors that happen with page navigation 
        * When a user is signing up, when they pick their birthday the user should not be able to choose a date in the future.
